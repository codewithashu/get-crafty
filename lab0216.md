## The DOM is...

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** provides a structured representation of the document.

It defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the

- document structure
- style
- content

The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.

### Understanding structure/node exercise

## JS 101

Create a new [codepen](http://codepen.io).

### Data types

- string
- number
- boolean

**Review**: Define three varibles of each type respectively. Then check with

`typeof(varible)`

### console.log

`console.log('please tell me the secret of life')`

## Arrays

```
var mags = ['The New Yorker','Nautilus','N+1'];

console.log(mags);
console.log(mags.length);
console.log(mags.length(0));
```

### Push

```
mags.push('Bon Appetit');

console.log(mags);
```

### Loop

```
mags.forEach(function(oneMag){
	console.log('I read ' + oneMag);
});
```

*= There are quite a few methods for looping an array. See supplement reading.

### Map

```
var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
var doubles = numbers.map(function(oneNumber,iterator){
	return oneNumber * 2;	
});

console.log(doubles)
```

### Join

```
var words = ['what','a','wonderful','life'];

words.join();
words.join('');
words.join(' ');

console.log(words);
```

### Push

```
words.push('amirite');

console.log(words);
```

### Slice

```
partial = words.slice(1,4);

console.log(partial)
```

### Objects

```
var favMag = {};

favMag.name = 'Nautilus';
favMag.genre = 'science';
favMag.interns = ['JoAnna Klein','Susie Neilson','Ankur Paliwal']
favMag.notinterns= [
	{"name":"John Steele", "role":"Publisher and Editorial Director"},
	{"name":"Michael Segal", "role":"Editor in Chief"},
	{"name":"Meehan Crist", "role":"Editor-at-Large"},
]

console.log(favMag);
console.log(favMag.interns);
```

### Functions

```
function addTwoNumbers(num1,num2){
	return num1 + numb2
}

addNumbers(3,4)
```

#### Callback

passing one function into another

```
function addPumpkinsAfterCalculation(num1,num2,calculation){
	return calculation + ' pumpkins'
}

addPumpkinsAfterCalculation(4, 5, addTwoNumbers)
```

## Homework

### A primer on branching

Create a new branch and go to there:

`git checkout -b refactor`

Check which branch you're on:

`git branch`

When pushing:

`git push origin refactor`

Refactor your `js` files from homework 1.

### Goal

- Write four calculating functions.
- Complete a fifth function that populates the html with a sentence describing the calculation. You've already done it - "when I add x and y I get z". But Unlike the previous homework, you are no longer constrained by the two varibles you defined. With this function, you can create content with combinations of ANY two numbers.
- Excecute the function once per type of calculation.

### How

Read the instructions in [this semi-finished `js` file](https://gist.github.com/jueyang/c2190c014421de494e0b) and complete it. It walks you through re-writing your javascript.
